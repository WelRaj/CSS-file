   <p id="para">A destructor is also a special member function as a constructor.
        Destructor destroys the class objects created by the constructor.
        Destructor has the same name as their class name preceded by a tilde (~) symbol.
        It is not possible to define more than one destructor.
        The destructor is only one way to destroy the object created by the constructor.
        Hence destructor can-not be overloaded.</p>
